Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.

- databases that store and provides access to data points that relate to one another. Each row in a table is connected to a unique ID.
- SQL is a query language that communicates with a Relational Database.

Why do tables need a primary key?
-It allows accessibility to each row, and is individual to that row. This allows other tables to reference the row given the specific primary key.

What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
-foreign key on a "many" table POINTS to a primary key on a "one" table

What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

- an "intermediary table", which references the primary keys from 2 or more different tables.
